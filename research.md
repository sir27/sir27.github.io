### Robot re-embodiment and co-embodiment

AI agents and robots can behave in many ways that humans cannot. One capability they have is re-embodiment: moving the same social presence or "identity" across physical devices, or from "body" to "body". We used props, furniture, and low-fidelity robot prototypes to turn our lab into a near-future hotel lobby, health clinic, and DMV (among other service environments), and immersed participants in several semi-scripted scenarios involving robot re-embodiment. We explored the question: How should robots that re-embody personalize experiences to users across multiple services? We then deployed storyboards online to address follow-up questions related to re-embodiment vis-a-vis expertise, perceived risk, and social status.

### Imagining smart futures

### Agents in care networks

### Augmented reality-enabled co-located play

### Multi-robot sequential interactions

I am interested in all things people + technology + interpersonal outcomes, and welcome collaborations proposals that sit anywhere in, or intersect with, that space.
