**How to email faculty**

If you are a student or a prospective student interested in doing research with a faculty member, don't be afraid to reach out. We don't bite!

ACADEMIA HAS WEIRD NORMS, SO DOES THE US, THERE'S NO REASON YOU WOULD KNOW THESE THINGS IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN EXPOSED TO THEM SO THE GOAL OF THIS GUIDE IS TO MAKE THEM EXPLICIT

_Addressing professors_

In the U.S., most faculty members prefer to be addressed as one of the following:

- Dr. LastName
- Professor/Prof. LastName
- Professor/Prof. FirstName
- FirstName

Aside from degree credential-related titles ("Professor" and "Dr."), we do not go by formal honorifics. We do not typically use gendered terms\* like "Sir", "Mam", or "Madam" in professional academic contexts. Additionally, there's no need to add an adjective (such as "respected") before someone's title.

A good way to start an email to me is:

"""Dear Dr. Reig, """

\*I receive a lot of emails that begin "Dear Sir". MORE HERE ABOUT HOW THIS IS ANNOYING AS HECK.
