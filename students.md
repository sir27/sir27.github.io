The following are projects I am working on in 2024-2025:

- Identity presentation for language-capable robots in smart environments
- Healthy aging and the future of tech support
- Situational awareness, identity, and well-being in the age of distributed collaboration
- Creativity & collaboration with generative AI

I am actively recruiting students for all of these projects. If you are a prospective student, here are some ways to work with me (categorized by level):

#### Prospective PhD students

I am looking for PhD students to start in fall 2024 or later. Please [submit an application to the university](https://www.uml.edu/sciences/computer-science/programs/doctorate.aspx) and mention my name in your application. In your personal statement, discuss your specific research interests (remember: itâ€™s a starting point, not a promise!) and describe why you want to pursue a PhD. Please feel free to reach out to me at any point during your application process.

We admit students on a rolling basis. The [UML CIS Graduate Program website](https://www.cs.uml.edu/~gcoord/index.html) is a useful resource for information about the application progress, the graduate curricula, etc.

#### MS students already at UMass Lowell

Send me an email with your CV and a brief description of your research interests. If you have no prior experience with HCI or with user studies, I will probably recommend that you take HCI or a related class before applying for a research position.

#### Undergraduate students already at UMass Lowell

The university runs several programs to facilitate research opportunities for undergraduate students. The Immersive Scholars program If you are a part of one of these programs, please look for announcements from them about research opportunities; they'll usually include a listing from me called "research in HCI" or similar (I'm recruiting Immersive Scholars for summer 2024 right now!). You can also reach out to me on your own -- see the "MS students" section above.

#### Undergraduate students not at UMass Lowell

I do not have any opportunities for non-UML undergraduate researchers right now, but I may in the future. Please keep an eye on this page.

#### Pro tips

I receive a lot of emails asking about research opportunities. Unfortunately, I cannot reply to all of them right away, and there are many that I cannot get to at all. Please feel free to take a look at my [guide to emailing faculty](/emailing-faculty.md) to read some advice about how to make it more likely I'll get back to you in a timely manner.
