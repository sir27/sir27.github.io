### Robot re-embodiment and co-embodiment

AI agents and robots can behave in many ways that humans cannot. One capability they have is re-embodiment: moving the same social presence or "identity" across physical devices, or from "body" to "body". We used props, furniture, and low-fidelity robot prototypes to turn our lab into a near-future hotel lobby, health clinic, and DMV (among other service environments), and immersed participants in several semi-scripted scenarios involving robot re-embodiment. We explored the question: How should robots that re-embody personalize experiences to users across multiple services? We then deployed storyboards online to address follow-up questions related to re-embodiment vis-a-vis expertise, perceived risk, and social status.

### User experience of smart environments

Research into user experience design for smart environments is often situated in the home, focused on a single physical device or interface, or based on a model of smart environment technologies as either fully interoperable or entirely independent. In reality, "smart environments" exist in a variety of domains (home, work, service, and highly-specialized settings), interact with different types of users, and have different objectives. We conducted a literature review focused on the smart environment as a unit of analysis for UX research and design. We identified five lenses that distinguish different types of smart environments from one another, and proposed ways for researchers and designers to use the lenses to better understand and create the UX of smart environments.

### _What else?_

I am interested in all things people + technology + interpersonal outcomes, and welcome collaborations proposals that sit anywhere in, or intersect with, that space.
